# IntelliJ Askama Template Support
Adds (currently very basic) support for Askama template files to IntelliJ platform IDEs.
By default, this plugin recognizes `.askama` as a template file, however you can change this in File Associations.

I plan to add support for most, if not all, Askama keywords in the future and Rust integration too.
