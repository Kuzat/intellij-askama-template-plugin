# IntelliJ Askama Template Support
Adds (currently very basic) support for Askama template files to IntelliJ platform IDEs.
By default, this plugin recognizes `.askama` as a template file, however you can change this in File Associations.

I plan to add support for most, if not all, Askama keywords in the future and Rust integration too.

## Installation
I'm waiting for this to be reviewed on the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16591-askama-template-support) but for now you can download the .zip file from the [Releases section](https://github.com/SamJakob/intellij-askama-template-plugin/releases/).

You can then install the plugin by opening the Plugin Manager, selecting the options icon to the right of 'Installed' and clicking 'Install Plugin from Disk...'.
